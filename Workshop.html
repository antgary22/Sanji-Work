<h1>Oda’s development of Sanji!  Part 1</h1>
		<img src="sanji.png">
<p>We’ve gotten so much foreshadowing for Sanji’s past that I’m starting to think that Oda always had some special plans for him out of all the strawhats. I think he’s had everyone’s backstory more or less thought out since the beginning, but I get the feeling that he’s been more detailed with Sanji’s. And also that he’s had Sanji’s past in mind as a way to move the story forward since very early on too.
Of course we don’t know everything yet, but there are still plenty of things to discuss that could possibly be Oda’s little hints at what was to come. After the latest chapters (841 and 842) I finally feel like we have enough grasp of Sanji’s past for me to actually post this (This post has been growing for a long time now). 
This post is about the possible clues that Oda has left when it comes to Sanji’s past. But also how Sanji as a character has been developed so well that with all this new information the audience can now understand the roots of Sanji’s personality and can look at old scenes and see a deeper meaning behind them. So this is basically a combination of character analysis, story analysis and some theory/specualtion. All in all, this is mostly a post to highlight how incredibly talented Oda is and how he definitely has paid some special attention to Sanji.
This is a long post that goes in a mostly chronological order from Baratie until the current WHole Cake Island arc, along with new information regarding Sanji’s past. This is the first part out of two and will cover everything from Sanji’s introduction until Enies Lobby. This is part one of two, if you’ve already read this GO HERE for Part 2. There will be heavy SPOILERS up until chapter 842.</p>
